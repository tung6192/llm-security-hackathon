You can do this by simply trying to access this address in a web browser or using a tool like curl. 2. Verify the command: Make sure that the -http connect-node command is recognized by the Jenkins command-line client. Review the Jenkins CLI documentation or use the 'help' command to see if it's a valid command. 3. Check file accessibility: If the files are not accessible, check the file permissions on the Jenkins server.

Parameter provided templates are disabled by default, but can be enabled by setting `params.resource.loader.enabled` by defining a response writer with that setting set to `true`. Defining a response writer requires configuration API access.
